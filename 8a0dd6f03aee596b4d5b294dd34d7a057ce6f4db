  * debian/apparmor/libvirt-lxc (sync with container-base with lxc):
    - remove bare 'signal' and 'ptrace' rules (base abstraction covers most
      of what we need)
    - allow signal (receive) peer=/usr/sbin/libvirtd
    - allow ptrace peer=@{profile_name}
    - deny mount options=(ro, remount, silent) -> /
    - allow mount fstype=hugetlbfs
    - shuffle a couple of rules around to make it easier to diff with lxc
      policy
  * debian/apparmor/TEMPLATE.lxc (sync with lxc-default):
    - use attach_disconnected and mediate_deleted
    - deny mount fstype=devpts,
