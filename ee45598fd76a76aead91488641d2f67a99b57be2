  * debian/apparmor/usr.sbin.libvirtd: switch to enforcing by default. Please
    note that this was only in complain mode temporarily to work around kernel
    bugs in the 2.6.31-9 kernel. Confinement of virtual machines (controlled
    by /etc/apparmor.d/libvirt/TEMPLATE) was already in enforcing mode.
    (LP: #427338)
  * debian/README.Debian: update AppArmor section based on the upstream
    documentation
