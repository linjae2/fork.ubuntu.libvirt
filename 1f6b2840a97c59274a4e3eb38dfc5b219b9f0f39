  * Merged with Debian unstable
    - this picks up a fix for migrations using NFS mounts (LP: #1637601).
  * Remaining changes:
    - Disable sheepdog (universe dependency)
    - Disable libssh2 support (universe dependency)
    - Disable firewalld support (universe dependency)
    - Disable selinux
    - Enable esx support
      - Add build-dep to libcurl4-gnutls-dev (required for esx)
    - Set qemu-group to kvm (for compat with older ubuntu)
    - Added changes to use the upstream apparmor profiles with added
      delta (configurable via apparmor profiles version).
      * d/p/u/000[1-6]-apparmor-*
    - Regularly clear AppArmor profiles for vms that no longer exist
    - Fix name resolution calls from virt-aa-helper profile (LP 1546674).
    - Add missing apparmor rule for debug-threads feature (LP 1615550).
    - Add new block device types to virt-aa-helpers profile (LP 1641618)
    - Additional apport package-hook
    - d/rules: debhelper start virtlogd.socket
    - Add sysvinit script for virtlockd
    - Additional debian/bug-presubj
    - Modifications to adapt for our delayed switch away from libvirt-bin (can
      be dropped after 18.04).
      - d/p/ubuntu/libvirtd-service-add-bin-alias.patch: alias to old

    - Wait on socket in sysvinit script
    - Backwards compatible handling of groups (can be dropped after 18.04).
    - config details and autostart of default bridged network. Creating that is
      now the default in general, yet our solution provides the following on
      top as of today:
      - nat only on some ports <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
      - autostart the default network by default
      - do not autostart if 192.168.122.0 is already taken (e.g. in containers)

    - ubuntu/parallel-shutdown.patch: set parallel shutdown by default.
    - d/p/ubuntu/enable-kvm-spice.patch: compat with older Ubuntu qemu/kvm
      which provided a separate kvm-spice.
    - d/p/ubuntu/storage-default-permission-mode-to-0711: safer default perms
      for storage dirs like /var/lib/libvirt/images.
    - d/p/ubuntu/storage-disable-gluster-test: gluster not enabled, skip test

  * Dropped Changes:
    - Build depend on gnutls >= 3.5.6-4ubuntu2 (no > 3.5.6 && < 3.5.6-4ubuntu2
      in any release left)
    - Fix parsing non apparmor labels LP:#1633207 (upstream in libvirt 2.5)
    - Ignore newlines in guest list (upstream in libvirt 2.4)
    - Avoid migration postcopy issues by ensuring valid commands (upstream in

    - Enable numa for arm64 (in Debian)
    - Fix libvirt start failure when security_driver set (upstream in libvirt
      2.2)
    - virt-aa-helper: Fix upstream implementation of no explicit deny rule
      (upstream in libvirt 2.3)
    - Some useless whitespace damage and no more applicable comments
    - The following patches were part of the Delta but not the series file.
      So they had no effect and can be dropped now:
      - ubuntu/9036-util-prepare-uri-for-libxml2-2.9.2.patch
      - ubuntu/Disable-failing-virnetsockettest.patch
      - ubuntu/dont-include-non-migrateable-features-in-host-model
      - ubuntu/upstream-libxl-Allow-libxl-to-find-pygrub-binary.patch
    - See the 2.1.0-1ubuntu15 and 2.1.0-1ubuntu16 changelogs for related
      pre-merge drops
    - Add build-dep to libxml-libxml-perl (no more needed)
    - apparmor double add /usr/bin/qemu-sparc64 rmix (no function anymore)
    - apparmor /usr/{lib,lib64}/qemu/block-*.so (in Debian)
    - apparmor moving /bin/bash rmix in profile (drop non functional delta)
    - follow Debians style of block-*.so rules for block-extra (drop our
      functionally equivalent adding/moving of rules)
    - follow Debians style of lib/lib64 rules (drop a lot of our functional
      functionally equivalent adding/moving of rules)
    - accept Upstream style to handle libvirt_iohelper and libvirt_parthelper
      (stop removing the two rules without an associated bug to reduce delta)
    - Disabling dep8 smoke tests
  * Added Changes:
    - d/t/control, d/t/smoke-qemu-session: fixup smoke-qemu-session by making
      vmlinuz available and accessible (in discussed with Debian in debbug
      848314)
    - d/t/control, d/t/smoke-lxc: fix up lxc smoke test (in discussed with
