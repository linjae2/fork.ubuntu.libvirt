      + Add versioned Conflicts/Replaces to libvirt0 for libvirt0-dbg,
        since we used to ship them as such
      + We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references
      + Build-Depends on libxml2-utils
      + Build-Depends on open-iscsi-utils instead of open-iscsi due to

    - Dropped the following patches now included upstream:

      + 9090-reenable-nonfile-labels.patch
      + 9091-apparmor.patch
      + 9092-apparmor-autoreconf.patch
  * AppArmor integration updates:
    - debian/apparmor/usr.sbin.libvirtd: allow libvirtd access to
      /usr/lib/libvirt/* (LP: #480478)
    - debian/apparmor/libvirt-qemu: allow guests access to
      /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc/** (LP: #484562)
    - debian/libvirt-bin.postinst: 0.7.2 moved /usr/bin/virt-aa-helper to
      /usr/lib/libvirt, so the profile changed from usr.bin.virt-aa-helper
      to usr.lib.libvirt.virt-aa-helper and needs to be migrated. If the user
      made no changes to the old profile, remove it, otherwise, update the
      paths, preserving the shipped usr.lib.libvirt.virt-aa-helper
    - update to 0.7.4 version of the sVirt AppArmor driver (can be dropped in

      + debian/patches/9010-apparmor-lp460271.patch
      + debian/patches/9011-apparmor-code-cleanups.patch

      upstream tarball (can be dropped in 0.7.5):
      + debian/patches/9012-apparmor-add-virt-aa-helper-test.patch
      + debian/patches/9013-apparmor-examples.patch
      + debian/rules: add post-patches target to make virt-aa-helper-test
        executable
  * debian/patches/0005-Fix-SELinux-linking-issues.patch: updated to work
    when both apparmor and selinux are available. This patch should be

  * debian/patches/9007-default-config-test-case.patch: updated to not fail
    if building in a deep directory
  * debian/patches/9014-event-fuzz.patch: add a little fuzz to not be quite
