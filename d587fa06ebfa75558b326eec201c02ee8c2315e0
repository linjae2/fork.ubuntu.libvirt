  * fix conffile upgrade handling to avoid obsolete files
    and inactive duplicates (LP: #1694159)
    - d/libvirt-daemon-system.maintscript: revert to Debian content
    - d/libvirt-bin.maintscript: add missing rm_conffile related to
      dropping upstart.
    - d/libvirt-bin.maintscript: add missing rm of conffiles due
      to re-aligning with debian package names since yakkety.
    - d/libvirt-bin.maintscript: for LTS->LTS upgraders try to move and retain
      custom changes.
    - d/libvirt-bin.maintscript: for upgraders from yakkety or later remove
      the (now duplicate) conffiles, but retain custom changes in backups if
      they exist
    - d/libvirt-bin.preinst: drop manual mv of conffiles which lacked
      retaining changes and upgrade-abort handling.
    - d/libvirt-bin.preinst: handle upgrades up to the latest predecessor
      possible before yakkety.
    - d/libvirt-bin.preinst: fixup the combination of rm+mv conffile in case
      the package is upgrading from pre yakkety.
    - d/libvirt-daemon-system.postinst: clean up old dnsmasq enablement symlink
      if unmodified.
