  * Move creation of /var/log/libvirt/{lxc,uml,qemu} dirs from libvirt-bin.dirs
    to libvirt-bin.postinst.  Otherwise after a 'apt-get remove libvirt-bin',
    that dir will be removed (if empty) but /etc/logrotate.d/libvirtd will 
    still try to rotate it and raise errors. (LP: #886770)
  * debian/rules: Fix a bug in the new logic for installing upstream-supplied
    logrotate files.  (LP: #887312)
