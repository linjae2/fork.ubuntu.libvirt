  * Merge from debian unstable. Remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + Build-Depends on qemu-kvm, not qemu
      + Build-Depends on open-iscsi-utils, not open-iscsi
      + Build-Depends on libxml2-utils
      + Build-Depends on libapparmor-dev and Suggests apparmor (>=
        2.3+1289-0ubuntu14)
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables
        to Depends of libvirt-bin
      + Recommends qemu-kvm (>= 0.11.0-0ubuntu6)
      + Add versioned Conflicts/Replaces to libvirt0 for libvirt0-dbg,
        since we used to ship them as such
      + We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references
      + temporarily remove Build-Depends on libcap-ng-dev, which isn't
        available in Ubuntu main yet
      + Rename Vcs-* to XS-Debian-Vcs-*
    - debian/libvirt-bin.postinst:
      + rename the libvirt group to libvirtd
      + add each admin user to the libvirtd group
      + reload apparmor profiles
      + 0.7.2 moved /usr/bin/virt-aa-helper to /usr/lib/libvirt, so the
        profile changed from usr.bin.virt-aa-helper to
        usr.lib.libvirt.virt-aa-helper and needs to be migrated. If the user
        made no changes to the old profile, remove it, otherwise, update the
        paths, preserving the shipped usr.lib.libvirt.virt-aa-helper
    - debian/libvirt-bin.postrm:
      + rename the libvirt group to libvirtd
      + remove apparmor symlinks on purge
    - debian/libvirt-bin.preinst: added to force complain on certain
      upgrades
    - debian/README.Debian: add AppArmor section based on the upstream
      documentation
    - debian/rules:
      + update DEB_DH_INSTALLINIT_ARGS for upstart
      + add DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET := check
      + use --with-apparmor
      + copy apparmor and apport hook to debian/tmp
    - add debian/libvirt-bin.upstart
    - debian/libvirt-bin.dirs: add /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions,
      /etc/apparmor.d/disable, /etc/apparmor.d/force-complain,
      /etc/apparmor.d/libvirt, /etc/cron.daily and
      /usr/share/apport/package-hooks
    - add debian/libvirt-bin.cron.daily
    - add debian/libvirt-bin.apport
    - debian/libvirt-bin.install: install apparmor profiles, abstractions
      and apport hook
    - debian/patches/series: don't apply 0002-qemu-disable-network.diff.patch
      + 9000-delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch
      + 9001-dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch
      + 9002-better_default_uri_virsh.patch
      + 9003-increase-logoutput-timeout.patch
      + 9004-better-default-arch.patch
      + 9005-libvirtd-group-name.patch
      + 9006-increase-unix-socket-timeout.patch
      + 9007-default-config-test-case.patch
      + 9008-warn-on-daemon-conf-test-wait.patch (renamed from 9016)
    - Dropped the following patches now including upstream:
      + 0005-Fix-SELinux-linking-issues.patch

      + 9012-apparmor-add-virt-aa-helper-test.patch
      + 9013-apparmor-examples.patch
      + 9014-event-fuzz.patch
      + 9015-hal-startup-failure-is-nonfatal.patch
  * debian/patches/9009-run-as-root-by-default.patch: run virtual machines
    via qemu:///system as root. As of 0.7, upstream libvirt has the ability to
    run VMs started via qemu:///system as an unprivileged user. Debian's
    libvirt now runs these VMs as libvirt-qemu:kvm. However, the upstream
    implementation is contentious among the community and while the it does
    reduce the privileges of the VMs running under qemu:///system, all VMs
    currently run under the same user, so there is no guest isolation. Even if
    each user ran under its own user, an attacker could potentially break out
    of the VM and have unconfined user access (albeit non-root). In Ubuntu,
    Qemu/KVM virtual machines are already fully isolated and confined by the
    AppArmor security driver so this feature has been disabled. Once there is
    consensus among the community on the implementation and its use, changing
    this default in Ubuntu can be considered as an additional protection to
    the AppArmor driver.
  * debian/README.Debian: add section discussing the security implications of
    using qemu:///system
  * debian/patches/9010-apparmor-ftbfs.patch: fix missing bracket in
    virt-aa-helper.c and automake dependency declaration. This should be
    dropped in 0.7.6 or higher.
