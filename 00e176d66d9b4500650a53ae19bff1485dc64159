    As pointed on CVE-2011-1146, some API forgot to check the read-only
    status of the connection for entry point which modify the state
    of the system or may lead to a remote execution using user data.
    The entry points concerned are:
      - virConnectDomainXMLToNative
      - virNodeDeviceDettach
      - virNodeDeviceReAttach
      - virNodeDeviceReset
      - virDomainRevertToSnapshot
      - virDomainSnapshotDelete
     src/libvirt.c: fix the above set of entry points to error on read-only
     connections (Closes: #617773)
