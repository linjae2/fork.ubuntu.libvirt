  * [ba504f6] systemd: Hardcode output of dh_installsystemd
    - Stop using dh_installsystemd and hardcode slightly tweaked
      versions of its output in maintainer scripts instead, as a
      temporary workaround for #994204
  * [4c89356] systemd: Only ever restart libvirtd on upgrade
    - This avoids guests being stopped or crashing during upgrades
