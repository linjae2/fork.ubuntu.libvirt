  * [1894ff0] Use libvirt-qemu as group for qemu-kvm related directories since
    this is the group we run the process with.
  * [adf14d0] Make sure qemu guest agent related directories are
    readable/writeable by the kvm process (Closes: #717406)
  * [b7c1b69] Explicitly enable sheepdog support we already set the configure
    params but didn't pass them on. Sheepdog support was enabled anyway due to
    ./configure autoprobing.
  * [85436a4] No need for gawk.  Awk isn't used in libvirt anymore and
    virt-pki-validate can cope with mawk. (Closes: #703380)
  * [20cacff] New upstream version 1.1.3~rc1
  * [fe3ccca] Drop patches fixed upstream.
