  * ubuntu-xen-fix-api-deadlocks.patch (LP: #1191782)
    Fix the deadlocks in the xen driver when doing a dumpxml for active
    domains.
  * ubuntu-libxl-qemu-nopath.patch
    Create libxl configurations without paths for qemu-dm and hvmloader.
    The Xen toolstack can figure this out.
  * ubuntu-xen-hypervisor-4.3.patch
    Update the xen driver to handle the new sysctl and domctl versions
    in Xen-4.3.
  * Add apparmor definitions to execute scripts in /etc/xen/scrips as
    the libxl driver calls out to them (with the xen/xm driver this was
    done by the xen toolstack and communication with that was through
    a socket).
