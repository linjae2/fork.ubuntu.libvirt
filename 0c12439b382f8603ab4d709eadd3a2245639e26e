  [ Guido GÃ¼nther ]
  * [949fae6] Suggest systemd since it improves thinks like e.g. cgroup
    handling
  * [96f9aae] Make mounted cgroups configurable via /etc/default/libvirt-bin
    and check for memory cgroup on kernel command line. (Closes: #732666)
  * [ce356fe] Really remove "memory" from default mount list. Thanks to phep
    <phep-lists@teletopie.net>
  [ Laurent Bigonville ]
  * [13052e4] Enable selinux driver (Closes: #688179)
  * [a00df46] Switch LSB dependencies to avahi-daemon since only the later
    exists as native systemd service. (Closes: #731612)
