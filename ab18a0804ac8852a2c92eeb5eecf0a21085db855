  * debian/patches/9013-apparmor-dont-clear-caps.patch: Don't clear
    capabilities when calling virt-aa-helper. When built with libcap-ng,
    clearing caps makes virt-aa-helper lose MAC_ADMIN, which is (obviously)
    needed by apparmor_parser. This restores libcap-ng behavior to what it was
    when not built with libcap-ng. (LP: #517714)
