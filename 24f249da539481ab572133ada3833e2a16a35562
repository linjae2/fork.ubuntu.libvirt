  * Merge from debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + Don't build-depend on QEmu.
      + Add "XS-Debian-" prefix to Debian's Vcs headers.
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables
        to Depends of libvirt-bin.
      + s/interract/interact/g
      + Add versioned Conflicts/Replaces to libvirt0 for libvirt0-dbg,
        since we used to ship them as such.
    - 9000-delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch:
      Don't try to bring up the bridge before at least one interface has been
      added to it.
    - 9001-dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch
      Assign the name of the virtual bridge dynamically to avoid interfering
      with existing bridges.
    - 9002-better_default_uri_virsh.patch:
      Default to qemu:///system if the user has write access to the libvirt
      socket, otherwise qemu:///session.
    - 9003-increase-logoutput-timeout.patch:
      increase timeout waiting for log output in src/qemu_driver.c, set to 30
      seconds, which 10x longer than before, and matches the disk-wait in
      mdadm. (LP #344400)
    - 9004-better-default-arch.patch:
      If a domain does not specify its architecture, attempt to match the host.
      (LP #344913)
    - 9005-libvirtd-group-name.patch:
      Rename libvirt group to libvirtd.
    - We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references.
