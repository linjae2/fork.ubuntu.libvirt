  * [b0b7359] Don't pretend kFreeBSD supports linux only features.  So far we
    worked around missing kFreeBSD features by creating empty dirs this looks
    bad on the target systems and makes us maintain things in debian rules and
    *.install. Explicitly invoke dh_install in debian/rules instead.
    Closes: #747658
