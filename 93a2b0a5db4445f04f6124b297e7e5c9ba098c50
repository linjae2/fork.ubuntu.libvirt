  * Merged with Debian git 5.3.0-1~1.gbp7b1637 and upstreams 5.4 release
    Among many other new features and fixes this includes fixes for:
    LP: #1759509 - virsh dompmwakeup fails to wake VM from dompmsuspend state
    Remaining changes:
    - Disable libssh2 support (universe dependency)
    - Disable firewalld support (universe dependency)
    - Set qemu-group to kvm (for compat with older ubuntu)
    - Additional apport package-hook
    - Autostart default bridged network (As upstream does, but not Debian).
      In addition to just enabling it our solution provides:
      + do not autostart if subnet is already taken (e.g. in guests).
      + iterate some alternative subnets before giving up
    - d/p/ubuntu/Allow-libvirt-group-to-access-the-socket.patch: This is
      the group based access to libvirt functions as it was used in Ubuntu
      for quite long.
      + d/p/ubuntu/daemon-augeas-fix-expected.patch fix some related tests
        due to the group access change.
      + d/libvirt-daemon-system.postinst: add users in sudo to the libvirt
        group.
    - ubuntu/parallel-shutdown.patch: set parallel shutdown by default.
    - Update Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser fields to point to launchpad
    - Xen related
      - d/p/ubuntu/ubuntu-libxl-qemu-path.patch: this change was split. The
        section that adapts the path of the emulator to the Debian/Ubuntu
        packaging is kept.
      - d/p/ubuntu/ubuntu-libxl-Fix-up-VRAM-to-minimum-requirements.patch: auto
        set VRAM to minimum requirements
      - d/p/ubuntu/xen-default-uri.patch: set default URI on xen hosts
      - Add libxl log directory
      - libvirt-uri.sh: Automatically switch default libvirt URI for users on
        Xen dom0 via user profile (was missing on changelogs before)
    - d/p/ubuntu/apibuild-skip-libvirt-common.h: drop libvirt-common.h from
      included_files to avoid build failures due to duplicate definitions.
    - Update README.Debian with Ubuntu changes
    - Enable some additional features on ppc64el and s390x (for arch parity)
      + systemtap, zfs, numa and numad on s390x.
      + systemtap on ppc64el.
    - d/t/control, d/t/smoke-qemu-session: fixup smoke-qemu-session by making
      vmlinuz available and accessible (Debian bug 848314)
    - d/t/control, d/t/smoke-lxc: fix up lxc smoke test isolation
    - d/p/ubuntu/ubuntu_machine_type.patch: accept ubuntu types as pci440fx
    - Further upstreamed apparmor Delta, especially any new one
      Our former delta is split into logical pieces and is either Ubuntu only
      or is part of a continuous upstreaming effort.

    - avoid service dependency issues on upgrade (LP: 1786179)
      This will in the long term be resolved in dh_* tools, but to let an
      upgrade work for now we need to drop the sysV scripts (which we don't
      use anyway) and slightly modify the systemd service to work with todays
      dh_systemd_start properly. Can be dropped once Debian bug 905772 is
      resolved in dh_* tools and libvirt uses those new code.
      - d/libvirt-daemon-system.virtlogd.init: removed sysV init file
      - d/libvirt-daemon-system.libvirtd.init: removed sysV init file
      - debian/libvirt-daemon-system.maintscript: rm_conffile for virtlogd
        and lbivirtd sysV init file
      - d/p/ubuntu/avoid-restarting-virtlog-socket.patch: drop Also references
        to virtlogd/virtlockd sockets as they would imply a restart of
        virtlogd breaking it.
      - d/t/smoke-lxc: use systemd instead of sysV to restart the service
