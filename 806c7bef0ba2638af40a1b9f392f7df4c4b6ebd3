  * d/p/ubuntu-xend-probe.patch:
    Update patch correctly and re-enable it. It seems like it only was
    half updated and then disabled without reasons.
  * d/p/ubuntu-libxl-Implement-basic-video-device-selection.patch:
    Re-activate adapted patch. Some pieces made it into upstream as a
    bug fix. The rest is still needed to allow selecing an alternate
    graphics device for Xen HVM guests.
  * d/p/ubuntu-libxl-Fix-up-VRAM-to-minimum-requirements.patch:
    Re-activate unchanged patch (for some reason dropped when moving
    to 1.2.6).
    This one is a bit of a work-around mainly for virt-manager which sets
    gfx memory to values below the minimum requirement for Xen. And the
    UI does not allow to change that. This patch just goes for the minimum
    in that case.
