  * [f6b0feb] Pass --with-selinux-mount=/sys/fs/selinux to ./configure.
    The buildd are not running selinux and this make the auto-detection code
    defaults to /selinux which is actually not existing anymore in sid.
    This complete the fix for SELinux support.
  [ Guido GÃ¼nther ]
  * Upload to experimental
  * [20d9129] Enable parallel build support.
    Thanks to Felix Geyer for pointing this out
  * [0d0590e] New upstream version 1.2.1~rc1. Fixes CVE-2013-6458
    (Closes: #734556)
  * [a3f978b] Bump symbol versions
  * [0a6a276] Rediff patches.
    Dropped (fixed upstream):
      security-fix-crash-in-lxcDomainGetMemoryParameters.patch
      security-fix-crash-in-lxcDomainSetMemoryParameters.patch
  * [3061b11] Build with apparmor support.
    Note that this isn't enough to run with apparmor support since the
    profiles will need more work but it makes testing this a lot simpler.
    This is heavily based on a patch by Felix Geyer.
    See: #725144
