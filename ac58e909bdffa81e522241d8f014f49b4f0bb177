  * [42dbd16] Skip more linux specific stuff on kFreeBSD
  * [a2ff23f] Don't restart virtlockd on upgrade virtlockd must be reloaded so
    it reexecs itself. (Closes: #757453)
  * [4914adc] Use symlinks for upstream changelog.  This safes 1.9M per
    package
  * [3583f4b] Don't fail qemu driver intialization if we can't determine
    hugepage size.  Thanks to a lot to Jamie Heilman for testing it
    (Closes: #757609)
  * [3b23724] Make 'uri' command a bit more prominent. (Closes: #688778)
  * [63e7e51] Also stop libvirt-bin in libvirt-bin's preinst.
    When libvirt-daemon-system's preinst runs the new libvirt-bin might
    already be unpacked and therefore the libvirt-bin service file already
    gone. So additionally stop libvirt-bin in libvirt-bin's preinst.
