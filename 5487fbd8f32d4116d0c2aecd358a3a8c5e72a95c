  * d/p/u/lp-1921754*: add EPYC-Rome-v2 as v1 missed IBRS and thereby fails
    on some HW/Guest combinations e.g. Windows 10 on Threadripper
    (LP: #1921754)
  * d/p/u/lp-1921880*: add EPYC-Milan features and named cpu type support
    (LP: #1921880)
  * d/p/u/lp-1922907: add ability to parse cpu stepping and thereby correctly
    differentiate skylake and cascadelake chips (LP: #1922907)
