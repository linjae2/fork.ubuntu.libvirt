  * [ea7b8b7] autopkgtest exits with 2 when there are skipped tests do not
    consider that as fatal
  [ Guido GÃ¼nther ]
  * [100e8aa] Don't start or restart socket units on package upgrades.
    Changes get picked up when the corresponding system unit is being restarted.
    This avoids problems when socket and service units of the same service get
    restarted together. See #955483 for details.
  * [ff981d5] Pass --no-auto to dh_instalsystemd.
    This avoids generation of restart snippets for services listed in `Also=`
    sections of the service units. Otherwise these get restarted but we want
    to avoid that and let systemd figure it out all by itself.
    See: #955483, #841095
