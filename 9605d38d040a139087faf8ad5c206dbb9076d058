  * update to allow pcidev and hostdev to work with AppArmor (LP: #545795)
    - debian/patches/lp-545795.patch: add vendor and device to
      pciDeviceFileIterate(). Patch submitted upstream and they feel it is
      reasonable, but not committed yet. This should fix pcidev.
    - debian/apparmor/usr.lib.libvirt.virt-aa-helper: add read access to
      /sys/bus/usb/devices/**
    - debian/apparmor/libvirt-qemu: adjust read access to be
      /sys/devices/**/usb[0-9]*/** instead of /sys/devices/*/*/usb[0-9]*/**.
      Patched based on work by Andreas Ntaflos.
