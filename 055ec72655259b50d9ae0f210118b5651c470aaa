  [ Andrea Bolognani ]
  * [684bb89] Move data files from libvirt-daemon to libvirt0.
    These files are used internally by the library, so they
    should be shipped along with it rather than with the daemon.
    This is consistent with the upstream libvirt.spec file.
    The pattern is partially expanded in the libvirt0.install
    file to avoid having to remove a specific subset of data
    files later on as part of debian/rules.
