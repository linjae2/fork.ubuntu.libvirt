  [ Guido Günther ]
  * [33890b9] New upstream version 6.0.0
    (Closes: #939552) 
  * [c9f82be] gitlab-ci: Run autopkgtests
  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * [fa167bc] d/libnss-libvirt.lintian-overrides: accept having two nss so
    files
  * [bf48357] d/libvirt-daemon-system-sysv.lintian-overrides: not shipping
    systemd files.  Packages are split intentionally, ignore this lintian
    warning.
  * [2278598] d/rules: also check build time self test results on all
    architectures
  * [c1be36a] d/rules: drop doc binary cleanup.
  * [6d60c3c] d/rules: don't ship split daemons just yet
  * [33f8dc4] d/p/skip-qemuhotplugtest.patch: fix qemuhotplugtest.
    Skip some elements of qemuhotplugtest that for now break in
    Debian/Ubuntu build environments.
  * [a1734f7] d/rules: add libvirt-guests.default to libvirt-daemon-system
    instead of libvirt-daemon-system-sysv
  * [69f6cfe] d/rules: install /etc/default/* files that are shared between
    sysv and systemd packages
  * [31be682] d/rules: install virtlockd for sysv
    (Closes: #880970)
  [ Andrea Bolognani ]
  * [070d158] Install virt-login-shell-helper.
    This new binary was introduced in libvirt 5.7.0 and is necessary for
    virt-login-shell to work.
  * [143dafb] Install augeas lenses for all drivers.
    These slipped through the cracks when we moved from picking up the
    corresponding directories as a whole to listing the specific files we're
    interested in.
  * [efa4cfe] Remove all mentions of Devhelp.
    As of libvirt 5.8.0, the corresponding files are no longer
    generated.
  * [8ebd427] not-installed: Remove obsolete entries.
    Now that upstream's build system has been fixed and we're picking up the
    documentation from the install location rather than the source directory,
    the corresponding files will no longer be flagged by dh_missing.
  * [ce54aef] not-installed: List all split daemons files.
    Since we're not shipping split daemons yet, the corresponding
    binaries as well as systemd units and augeas lenses will be
    flagged by dh_missing if we don't list them here.
  * [391e39d] symbols: Drop LIBVIRT_5.9.0
    libvirt 5.9.0 didn't introduce any new public symbols.
  [ Guido Günther ]
  * [443fae0] New upstream version 6.0.0~rc1
  * [70c5676] Bump symbol versions
  * [eb6c6c1] gitlab-ci: Build package.
    We unfortunately can't use salsa-ci's prebuilt pipeline since
    that hangs on large jobs:
    https://salsa.debian.org/salsa/support/issues/180
    We redirct output to a file to work around:
    https://salsa.debian.org/salsa/support/issues/191
  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * [cc6b955] refresh d/p/* for v6.0.0
  * [5639ffb] d/control: bump build dep to python3
  * [dc99d35] d/rules: set enable-dependency-tracking to avoid FTBFS.
  * [af131c7] d/rules: drop the no more existing xen configure option
  * [84367d9] d/control: add python3-docutils as build dependency

    conf files

    placement
