  * Merge with Debian experimental. Remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + Don't build-depend on QEmu.
      + Add "XS-Debian-" prefix to Debian's Vcs headers.
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables
        to Depends of libvirt-bin.
      + s/interract/interact/g
      + Add versioned Conflicts/Replaces to libvirt0 for libvirt0-dbg,
        since we used to ship them as such.
    - Rename libvirt group to libvirtd.
    - 0005-delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch: Don't try to bring up the bridge
      before at least one interface has been added to it.
    - dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch: Assign the name of the virtual
      bridge dynamically to avoid interfering with existing bridges.
    - better_default_uri_virsh.patch: Default to qemu:///system if the
      user has write access to the libvirt socket, otherwise
      qemu:///session.
    - We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references.
    - Included (but did not enable) opennebula patch (since it's not in
      main yet).
