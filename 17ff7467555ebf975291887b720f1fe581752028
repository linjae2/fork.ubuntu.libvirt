  * [1ec90c0] d/compat: Switch to debhelper level 12
      * [fb6dd18] d/rules: s/no-restart-on-upgrade/no-stop-on-upgrade/
      * [3764b71] d/rules: --prallel not needed anymore
      * [1d92095] d/control: Add ${misc:Pre-Depends} for
        libvirt-daemon-system. This makes sure we pull in recent enough
        init-system-helpers
  * [02a155b] d/rules: Switch to dh_installsystemd
    dh_systemd_start is no longer used.
  * [bcad111] d/control: Fix typo
  * [8609192] d/control: Drop Debian revision on iptables build-dep.  Any
    version greater than 1.8.1 will do.
  * [447dd58] libnss-libvirt: Install libnss_libvirt-guest as well
    (Closes: #910288)
  * [4fb7d11] d/control: Build-depend on libglusterfs-dev.
    Since this is a recent addition we can drop the versioned dependency.
    (Closes: #919663)
  * [7b4ffeb] d/rules: Newer debhelper puts the libs into multi arch dirs.
    There's no need to move them manually anymore.
  [ Andrea Bolognani ]

    This gets rid of the debian-watch-uses-insecure-uri informational Lintian
    tag, and then some.
  * [faaec12] Minimize upstream's signing key.
    This gets rid of the public-upstream-key-not-minimal informational Lintian
    tag.
  * [8a0e6f1] Remove Priority field from binary packages.
    This gets rid of the binary-control-field-duplicates-source informational
    Lintian tag.
  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]

    pages.
  * [0f359de] d/rules: mv logrotate files to silence dh_missing
