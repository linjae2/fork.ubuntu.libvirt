  * [5e71896] Move networking configuration to libvirt-daemon-system too
  * [32eea48] Remove left over empty directory
  * [b3a2735] Also purge libvirt-bin.service on new installations.
    The old service file was in libvirt-bin so we need to remove it when
    libvirt-daemon-service is first installed (as we did before when
    the whole code was in the postinst).
    Thanks to Laurent Bigonville for the analysis (Closes: #757293)
