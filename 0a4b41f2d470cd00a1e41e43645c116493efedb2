  * New upstream release
    - Drop nic-model, disk-bus, and ancient_parted.patch. They're all
      upstream now (in some form).
    - Add new libdevmapper-dev build-dependency.
  * Merge from debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + DebianMaintainerField
      + Don't build-depend on QEmu.
      + Add "XS-Original-" prefix to Debian's Vcs headers.
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables to Depends
        of libvirt-bin.
      + s/interract/interact/g
    - debian/libvirt-bin.default
      + Make libvirtd start by default
    - Add /var/lib/libvirt to libvirt-bin package. (dnsmasq needs it to store
      its state info.
    - Create /var/run/libvirt in libvirt-bin's init script.
    - Rename libvirt group to libvirtd.
    - Build iscsi and disk storage support.
    - delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch: Don't try to bring up the bridge before at
      least one interface has been added to it.
    - dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch: Assign the name of the virtual
      bridge dynamically to avoid interfering with existing bridges.
    - nic-model.patch: Add support for <model type='foo'/> NIC configuration.
    - disk-bus.patch:  Add support for bus='foo' attributes for disk targets.
    - better_default_uri_virsh.patch: Default to qemu:///system if the user
      has write access to the libvirt socket, otherwise qemu:///session.
    - ancient_parted.patch: Fix builds against libparted1.7
    - We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references.
  * reenable open-iscsi support  - thanks to to the open-iscsi
    maintainers for fixing this up
