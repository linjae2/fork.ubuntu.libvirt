  * [28dd361] Remove obsolete conffiles in libvirt-bin too. Depending on the
    upgrade path they can belong to either libvirt-bin or
    libvirt-daemon-system. (Closes: #764679)
  * [de9dcf9] Move polkit rule to /u/s/polkit-1/rules.d/
    since /e/polkit-1 is for admin changes (Closes: #764826)
  * [114d777] Remove unused python files. We split out libvirt-python ages
    ago.
  * [3a06d85] Add rules for older policy kit (as in jessie/sid).
    Thanks to Török Edwin, Wolodja Wentland and Michael Biebl
