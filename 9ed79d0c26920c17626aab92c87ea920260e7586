  * [d88536d] Introduce libvirt-daemon-system-{systemd,sysv} Move init scripts
    to separate package that allows people to experiment with alternative init
    systems while avoiding the problems that mixed init scripts and systemd
    units have in the current packaging.
    Thanks to Christian Ehrhardt for all the input regarding upgrade
    problems seen in Ubuntu and possible solutions.
    (Closes: #887911, #905772)
  * [c19d230] autopkg tests: Use isolation-machine.
    This avoids running under debian ci since libvirt-lxc in lxc
    doesn't work there. (Closes: #947006)
