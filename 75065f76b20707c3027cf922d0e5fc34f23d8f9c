  * [54daa55] Add Breaks for older systemd.
    These make us end up in the wrong parts of the cgroup hierarchy so we
    won't find our lxc instances after restart. This could likely be fixed
    in libvirt but forcing the newer version at least makes us not break
    running containers. (Closes: #774237)
  * [2caf1bb] Fix path to qemu-bridge-helper (Closes: #790935)
  * [77dcc1a] README.Debian: remove xend bits were using libxl now
  * [1b01f3f] Enable xen on armhf and amd64. Based on a patch by Yann
    Soubeyrand (Closes: #795516)
