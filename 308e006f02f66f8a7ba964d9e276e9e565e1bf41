  * [72790fc] Drop hal dependency We're using udev for device enumeration.
  * [ce225c4][11cc6e9] New patch
    0006-Don-t-drop-caps-when-exec-ing-qemu.patch: Don't drop caps when
    exec'ing qemu. Instead of disabling libcap-ng better exclude this one exec
    so we get the additional security for the rest of the calls. Makes
    interface type="network" work again. (Closes: #565767)
