  * updates for AppArmor signals and ptrace mediation (LP: #1298611)
    - debian/apparmor/libvirt-qemu: allow guests to receive signals from and
      be tracedby libvirtd (additional signal and ptrace rules come from the
      AppArmor base abstraction)
    - debian/apparmor/usr.sbin.libvirtd:
      + grant bare signal and ptrace rule
      + grant dbus on the system bus (should have been added in 13.10)
