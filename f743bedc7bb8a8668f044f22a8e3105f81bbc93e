  * Merge 1.3.4-1 from Debian unstable
  * Drop upstream-applied patches:
    - conf-also-mark-implicit-video-as-primary.patch
    - libvirt-socket-fix-group
  * Remaining changes
    - keep libvirt-bin transitional package - until 18.10 (for lts-to-lts
      upgrades)
    - keep (redundant) libvirtd group if it existed on upgrade - until 18.10
      (for lts-to-lts upgrades)
    - keep ubuntu-specific patches
    - ship apport and dnsmasq files
    - enable virbr0
    - ship apparmor from debian/*.  We should push changes upstrema, but
      cannot sync with debian as apparmor profiles must be processed in
      debian/rules for cloud archive.
    - debian/control
      - enable zfs
      - disable libssh2 and sheepdog
      - add libxml-libxml-perl and libcurl4-gnutls-dev
      - enable libnuma-dev on ppc64el (pushed to Debian)
      - update release for conflicts/replaces on libvirt-bin to << 1.3.3-2
    - debian/libvirt-daemon-system.preinst: stop libvirt-bin on certain
      upgrades.
      - Multi-arch-ify.
    - debian/rules: disable selinux and firewalld;  use 'kvm' group; disable
      ssh2, enable zfs and esx;  process apparmor files for older releases;
      copy dnsmasq configuration.
    - debian/tests/control: add extra depends
  * d/p/ubuntu/apibuild-skip-libvirt-common.h: libvirt-common.h is being
    included twice leading to build failures - drop it temporarily.
