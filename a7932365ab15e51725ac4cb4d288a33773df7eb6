  * Add AppArmor support (LP: #388422):
    - debian/patches/9090-reenable-nonfile-labels.patch: add back in
      virDomainObjPtr argument to RestoreSecurityImageLabel since AppArmor
      labels are not stored on disk
    - debian/patches/9091-apparmor.patch: add AppArmor security driver
    - debian/patches/9092-apparmor-autoreconf.patch: after installing libtool
      and the build dependencies, run autoreconf to pull in changes to
      Makefile.am and configure.in in 9091-apparmor.patch
    - debian/rules: use --with-apparmor and copy debian/apparmor/* to
      debian/tmp
    - debian/control: Build-Depends on libapparmor-dev and Suggests apparmor
      >= 2.3+1289-0ubuntu14
    - add profiles and abstractions to debian/apparmor. usr.sbin.libvirtd will
      default to complain mode until LP: #401931 is sorted out
    - debian/libvirt-bin.dirs: add /etc/apparmor.d/libvirt,
      /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions, and /etc/apparmor.d/force-complain
    - debian/libvirt-bin.install: install profiles and abstractions
    - debian/libvirt-bin.preinst: newly added to force complain on certian
      upgrades
    - debian/libvirt-bin.postinst: (re)load profile
    - debian/libvirt-bin.postrm: remove force-complain profile on purge
  * 9006-increase-unix-socket-timeout.patch:
    increase timeout waiting for unix socket in src/qemu_driver.c, set to 30
    seconds, which 10x longer than before, and matches the logoutput timeout
    adjustment in 9003-increase-logoutput-timeout.patch. This is needed with
    the new qemudOpenMonitorUnix() function introduced in 0.7.0.
  * add apport hook:
    - add debian/libvirt-bin.apport
    - debian/libvirt-bin.dirs: add /usr/share/apport/package-hooks
    - debian/libvirt-bin.install: add source_libvirt-bin.py
    - debian/rules: install libvirt-bin.apport
  * Merge from debian experimental, remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + Don't build-depend on QEmu.
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables
        to Depends of libvirt-bin.
      + Add versioned Conflicts/Replaces to libvirt0 for libvirt0-dbg,
        since we used to ship them as such.
      + We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references.
      + Build-Depends on open-iscsi-utils instead of open-iscsi due to
        LP: #414986
    - 9000-delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch:
      Don't try to bring up the bridge before at least one interface has been
      added to it.
    - 9001-dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch:
      Assign the name of the virtual bridge dynamically to avoid interfering
      with existing bridges.
    - 9002-better_default_uri_virsh.patch:
      Default to qemu:///system if the user has write access to the libvirt
      socket, otherwise qemu:///session.
    - 9003-increase-logoutput-timeout.patch:
      increase timeout waiting for log output in src/qemu_driver.c, set to 30
      seconds, which 10x longer than before, and matches the disk-wait in
      mdadm. (LP #344400)
    - 9004-better-default-arch.patch:
      If a domain does not specify its architecture, attempt to match the host.
      (LP #344913)
    - 9005-libvirtd-group-name.patch:
      Rename libvirt group to libvirtd.
    - rename the libvirt group to libvirtd in postinst/postrm
  * Dropped the following patches from debian/patches (they don't apply any
    more were not applied in 0.6.4-1ubuntu2):
    - dynamic_bridge_names.patch
    - event-loop-hang.diff
