  * d/p/u/lp2059272-1-qemu-Fix-potential-crash-during-driver-cleanup.patch:
    On QEMU driver cleanup, release (stop) the worker thread pool _first_,
    before other data used by possibly running worker threads (LP: #2059272)
  * d/p/u/lp2059272-2-qemu-Wait-qemuProcessReconnect-threads-in-cleanup.patch:
    On QEMU driver cleanup, also wait for qemuProcessReconnect() threads,
    as they are independent of the worker thread pool. (LP: #2059272) 
    Focal needs this as it has no .stateShutdownWait() callback yet.
    (The wait timeout is set in LIBVIRT_QEMU_STATE_CLEANUP_WAIT_TIMEOUT:
     -1 = wait indefinitely; 0 = do not wait; N = wait up to N seconds.)
