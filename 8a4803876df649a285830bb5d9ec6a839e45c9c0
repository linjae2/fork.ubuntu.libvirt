  * [d7a7218] Fix virtio-gpu + virgl support by cherry-picking upstream
    commits virt-manager in current sid still creates new VMs with QXL
    graphics by default, so this bug only affects users who opt in for
    virtio-gpu 3D acceleration.  Still, the option for virtio-gpu + 3D
    acceleration is offered in the virt-manager GUI, so having it broken by
    default is an important problem.
