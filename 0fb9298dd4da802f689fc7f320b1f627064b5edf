  * Merge from debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + DebianMaintainerField
      + Don't build-depend on QEmu.
      + Add "XS-Original-" prefix to Debian's Vcs headers.
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables to Depends
        of libvirt-bin.
      + s/interract/interact/g
      + Add versioned Conflicts/Replaces to libvirt0 for libvirt0-dbg, since
        we used to ship them as such.
    - Create /var/run/libvirt in libvirt-bin's init script.
    - Rename libvirt group to libvirtd.
    - 0005-delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch: Don't try to bring up the bridge before at
      least one interface has been added to it.
    - dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch: Assign the name of the virtual
      bridge dynamically to avoid interfering with existing bridges.
    - better_default_uri_virsh.patch: Default to qemu:///system if the user
      has write access to the libvirt socket, otherwise qemu:///session.
    - We call libxen-dev libxen3-dev, so change all references.
