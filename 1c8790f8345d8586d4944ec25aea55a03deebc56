  * d/libvirt-bin.init, d/libvirt-bin.upstart: fix waiting for the libvirt
    socket (LP: #1571209)
    - avoid timing out on slow systems (only stop when service is stopped)
    - fix whitespace damage formerly added to d/libvirt-bin.init
    - no more long sleep without announcing to log
    - check socket and service status more often for lower latency on changes
    - fix check if unix_sock_dir path is set in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf
    - fix the upstart service name that is checked
