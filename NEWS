   - fix the Python bindings bug when domain and connections where freed
   - First release
   - Basic management of existing Xen domains
   - Minimal autogenerated Python bindings
   - a node is a single physical machine
   - an hypervisor is a layer of software allowing to
    virtualize a node in a set of virtual machines with possibly different
    configurations than the node itself
   - a domain is an instance of an operating system running
    on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor
   - the API should not be targetted to a single virtualization environment
    though Xen is the current default, which also means that some very
    specific capabilities which are not generic enough may not be provided as
    libvirt APIs
   - the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations
    needed to manage domains on a node
   - the API will not try to provide hight level multi-nodes management
    features like load balancing, though they could be implemented on top of
    libvirt
   - stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate
    applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the
    virtualization framework
   - Xen hypervisor
   - QEmu and KVM based virtualization
   - the driver architecture
   - a connection to the Xen Daemon though an HTTP RPC layer
   - a read/write connection to the Xen Store
   - use Xen Hypervisor calls
   - when used as non-root libvirt connect to a proxy daemon running
      as root and providing read-only support
   - xend_internal: implements the driver functions though the Xen
  Daemon
   - xs_internal: implements the subset of the driver availble though the
    Xen Store
   - xen_internal: provide the implementation of the functions possible via
    direct hypervisor access
   - proxy_internal: provide read-only Xen access via a proxy, the proxy code
    is in the proxy/directory.
   - xm_internal: provide support for Xen defined but not running
    domains.
   - qemu_internal: implement the driver functions for QEmu and
    KVM virtualization engines. It also uses a qemud/ specific daemon
    which interracts with the QEmu process to implement libvirt API.
   - test: this is a test driver useful for regression tests of the
    front-end part of libvirt.

</domain>   - the optional <features> block is used to enable
    certain guest CPU / system features. For HVM guests the following
    features are defined:
    pae - enable PAE memory addressing
      apic - enable IO APIC
      acpi - enable ACPI bios
    
   - pae - enable PAE memory addressing
   - apic - enable IO APIC
   - acpi - enable ACPI bios
   - the <os> block description is very different, first
    it indicates that the type is 'hvm' for hardware virtualization, then
    instead of a kernel, boot and command line arguments, it points to an os
    boot loader which will extract the boot informations from the boot device
    specified in a separate boot element. The dev attribute on
    the boot tag can be one of:
    fd - boot from first floppy device
      hd - boot from first harddisk device
      cdrom - boot from first cdrom device
    
   - fd - boot from first floppy device
   - hd - boot from first harddisk device
   - cdrom - boot from first cdrom device
   - the <devices> section includes an emulator entry
    pointing to an additional program in charge of emulating the devices
   - the disk entry indicates in the dev target section that the emulation
    for the drive is the first IDE disk device hda. The list of device names
    supported is dependant on the Hypervisor, but for Xen it can be any IDE
    device hda-hdd, or a floppy device
    fda, fdb. The <disk> element
    also supports a 'device' attribute to indicate what kinda of hardware to
    emulate. The following values are supported:
    floppy - a floppy disk controller
      disk - a generic hard drive (the default it
      omitted)
      cdrom - a CDROM device
    
    For Xen 3.0.2 and earlier a CDROM device can only be emulated on the
    hdc channel, while for 3.0.3 and later, it can be emulated
    on any IDE channel.
   - floppy - a floppy disk controller
   - disk - a generic hard drive (the default it
      omitted)
   - cdrom - a CDROM device
   - the <devices> section also include at least one
    entry for the graphic device used to render the os. Currently there is
    just 2 types possible 'vnc' or 'sdl'. If the type is 'vnc', then an
    additional port attribute will be present indicating the TCP
    port on which the VNC server is accepting client connections.


KVM domain (added in 0.2.0) at 

:
<domain type='kvm'>
  <name>demo2</name>

    </interface>
    <graphics type='vnc' port='-1'/>
  </devices>
</domain>   - the top level domain element carries a type of 'kvm'
   - the <devices> emulator points to the special qemu binary required
    for KVM
   - networking interface definitions definitions are somewhat different due
    to a different model from Xen see below


Networking options for QEmu and KVM (added in 0.2.0) at 

:
   - Userspace SLIRP stack
    Provides a virtual LAN with NAT to the outside world. The virtual
    network has DHCP & DNS services and will give the guest VM addresses
    starting from 10.0.2.15. The default router will be
    10.0.2.2 and the DNS server will be 10.0.2.3.
    This networking is the only option for unprivileged users who need their
    VMs to have outgoing access. Example configs are:
    <interface type='user'/>
    
<interface type='user'>                                                  
  <mac address="11:22:33:44:55:66:/>                                     
</interface>
    
  

     - Virtual network
    Provides a virtual network using a bridge device in the host.
    Depending on the virtual network configuration, the network may be
    totally isolated,NAT'ing to aan explicit network device, or NAT'ing to
    the default route. DHCP and DNS are provided on the virtual network in
    all cases and the IP range can be determined by examining the virtual
    network config with 'virsh net-dumpxml <network
    name>'. There is one virtual network called'default' setup out
    of the box which does NAT'ing to the default route and has an IP range of
    192.168.22.0/255.255.255.0. Each guest will have an
    associated tun device created with a name of vnetN, which can also be
    overriden with the <target> element. Example configs are:
    <interface type='network'>
  <source network='default'/>
</interface>

<interface type='network'>
  <source network='default'/>
  <target dev='vnet7'/>
  <mac address="11:22:33:44:55:66:/>
</interface>
    
  

     - Bridge to to LAN
    Provides a bridge from the VM directly onto the LAN. This assumes
    there is a bridge device on the host which has one or more of the hosts
    physical NICs enslaved. The guest VM will have an associated tun device
    created with a name of vnetN, which can also be overriden with the
    <target> element. The tun device will be enslaved to the bridge.
    The IP range / network configuration is whatever is used on the LAN. This
    provides the guest VM full incoming & outgoing net access just like a
    physical machine. Examples include:
    <interface type='bridge'>
 <source dev='br0'/>
</interface>

<interface type='bridge'>
  <source dev='br0'/>
  <target dev='vnet7'/>

     - Generic connection to LAN
    Provides a means for the administrator to execute an arbitrary script
    to connect the guest's network to the LAN. The guest will have a tun
    device created with a name of vnetN, which can also be overriden with the
    <target> element. After creating the tun device a shell script will
    be run which is expected to do whatever host network integration is
    required. By default this script is called /etc/qemu-ifup but can be
    overriden.

     - Multicast tunnel
    A multicast group is setup to represent a virtual network. Any VMs
    whose network devices are in the same multicast group can talk to each
    other even across hosts. This mode is also available to unprivileged
    users. There is no default DNS or DHCP support and no outgoing network
    access. To provide outgoing network access, one of the VMs should have a
    2nd NIC which is connected to one of the first 4 network types and do the
    appropriate routing. The multicast protocol is compatible with that used
    by user mode linux guests too. The source address used must be from the
    multicast address block.
    <interface type='mcast'>
  <source address='230.0.0.1' port='5558'/>
</interface>
  

     - TCP tunnel
    A TCP client/server architecture provides a virtual network. One VM
    provides the server end of the netowrk, all other VMS are configured as
    clients. All network traffic is routed between the VMs via the server.
    This mode is also available to unprivileged users. There is no default
    DNS or DHCP support and no outgoing network access. To provide outgoing
    network access, one of the VMs should have a 2nd NIC which is connected
    to one of the first 4 network types and do the appropriate routing.
    Example server config:
    <interface type='server'>
  <source address='192.168.0.1' port='5558'/>
</interface>
    Example client config:
    <interface type='client'>
  <source address='192.168.0.1' port='5558'/>

</domain>   - the value of type on top-level domain, it's 'qemu' or kqemu if asking
    for kernel assisted
    acceleration
   - the os type block defines the architecture to be emulated, and
    optionally the machine type, see the discovery API below
   - the emulator string must point to the right emulator for that
    architecture

   - fix the Python bindings bug when domain and connections where freed
   - First release
   - Basic management of existing Xen domains
   - Minimal autogenerated Python bindings
   - a node is a single physical machine
   - an hypervisor is a layer of software allowing to
    virtualize a node in a set of virtual machines with possibly different
    configurations than the node itself
   - a domain is an instance of an operating system running
    on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor
   - the API should not be targetted to a single virtualization environment
    though Xen is the current default, which also means that some very
    specific capabilities which are not generic enough may not be provided as
    libvirt APIs
   - the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations
    needed to manage domains on a node
   - the API will not try to provide hight level multi-nodes management
    features like load balancing, though they could be implemented on top of
    libvirt
   - stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate
    applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the
    virtualization framework
   - Xen hypervisor
   - QEmu and KVM based virtualization
   - the driver architecture
   - a connection to the Xen Daemon though an HTTP RPC layer
   - a read/write connection to the Xen Store
   - use Xen Hypervisor calls
   - when used as non-root libvirt connect to a proxy daemon running
      as root and providing read-only support
   - xend_internal: implements the driver functions though the Xen
  Daemon
   - xs_internal: implements the subset of the driver availble though the
    Xen Store
   - xen_internal: provide the implementation of the functions possible via
    direct hypervisor access
   - proxy_internal: provide read-only Xen access via a proxy, the proxy code
    is in the proxy/directory.
   - xm_internal: provide support for Xen defined but not running
    domains.
   - qemu_internal: implement the driver functions for QEmu and
    KVM virtualization engines. It also uses a qemud/ specific daemon
    which interracts with the QEmu process to implement libvirt API.
   - test: this is a test driver useful for regression tests of the
    front-end part of libvirt.
