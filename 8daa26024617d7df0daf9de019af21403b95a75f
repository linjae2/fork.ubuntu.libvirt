  * d/p/libxl-Create-log-directory-earlier.patch:
    Move creation of log directory inside function that tries to create
    a log file inside of it. Fixes startup when the libxl log directory
    has not been created, yet.
  * d/p/libxl-do-not-use-virdomain-id.patch:
    Replace usage of dom->id with vm->def-id inside the driver (as that
    is not getting stale). Fixes guest creation and reboot through
    virt-manager (apart from possibly other things).
  * d/p/libxl-set-disk-format-for-cdrom.patch:
    Set disk format, otherwise an empty virtual CDROM makes the guest
    unstartable.
  * d/p/libxl-set-vfb0-data-in-build-config.patch:
    Actually set video and display data in the domain build info. Beside
    of preventing disagreement about VNC ports, this allows to select
    standard VGA graphics and more VRAM trhough libvirt.
