  * Merge 1.3.3-2 from Debian unstable
  * Merge new packaging layout
    - debian/control
      * add libsanlock-dev, dtrace, systemtap-sdt-dev, librados-dev,
        libfuse-dev, augeas-tools to Build-Depends.
      * Drop libcgmanager-dev from Build-Depends.
      * Add libvirt-clients, libvirt-daemon, and libvirt-daemon-system
        packages which replace the now-virtual libvirt-bin package.
      * Drop libvirt0-dbg (is this intential in Debian?)
      * Add libvirt-sanlock package (this should be in universe)
  * Switch to 'libvirt' group, keeping the same gid as 'libvirtd'

    site scripts use it.
  * Enable dtrace
  * Add Debian policy-kit configuration
  * drop ubuntu/9004-libvirtd-group-name.patch as we are switching to group
    'libvirt'
  * Drop obsolete migration scripts:
    - libvirt-migrate-xend-managed-domains
    - libvirt-migrate-qemu-disks
    - libvirt-migrate-qemu-machinetype
  * Remaining changes:
    - keep libvirt-bin transitional package - until 18.10 (for lts-to-lts
      upgrades)
    - keep (redundant) libvirtd group if it existed on upgrade - until 18.10
      (for lts-to-lts upgrades)
    - keep ubuntu-specific patches
    - ship apport and dnsmasq files
    - enable virbr0
    - ship apparmor from debian/*.  We should push changes upstrema, but
      cannot sync with debian as apparmor profiles must be processed in
      debian/rules for cloud archive.
