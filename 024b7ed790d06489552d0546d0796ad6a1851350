  * Fix bad SRU backport to match apparmor structure of libvirt
    in Xenial (LP: #1680384)
    - drop d/p/ubuntu/apparmor-shutdown.patch as the libvirt code here doesn't
      trigger it.
    - drop d/p/ubuntu/apparmor-vfio.patch as xenial still uses profiles from
      debian/apparmor/
    - apply content of apparmor-vfio.patch to debian/apparmor/libvirt-qemu
      to fix the actual issue.
