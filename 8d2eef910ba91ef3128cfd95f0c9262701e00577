   * Add apparmor rights to call into /usr/lib/xen-common/bin/xen-toolstack
     to figure out which one is active.
   * debian/patches/ubuntu-xend-probe.patch: Fix failure to detect
     whether Xen uses xm/xend toolstack or xl/libxl. Avoid running
     "xend status" as we do not package that in a pbublic path.
