  * debian/patches/9017-dont-disable-ipv6.patch: don't disable IPv6
    on the bridge interface. The original intent of disabling IPv6 was
    to prevent RAs received from client VMs from accidentally adding
    addresses to the bridge interface. However, only accept_ra=0 is
    necessary to fix this, without the side-effect of disabling IPv6.
    (LP: #528934)
