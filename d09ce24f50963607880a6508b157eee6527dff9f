  * [0ee351f] [CVE-2011-1146] Add missing checks for read only connections.
    Some API forgot to check the read-only status of the connection for
    entry point which modify the state of the system or may lead to a remote
    execution using user data.
    The entry points concerned are:
      - virConnectDomainXMLToNative
      - virNodeDeviceDettach
      - virNodeDeviceReAttach
      - virNodeDeviceReset
      - virDomainRevertToSnapshot
      - virDomainSnapshotDelete
    src/libvirt.c: fix the above set of entry points to error on read-only
    (Closes: #617773)
