  * New upstream release.
  * Don't change the default URI. It appears that too many applications
    still depend on this broken behaviour.
  * Change maintainer to ubuntu-core-dev.
  * Merge from debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - Add libvirt0-dbg package.
    - Start libvirtd by default.
    - Create libvirtd group, and have libvirtd's sockets have group ownership
      "libvirtd".
    - Add libxen as a build-dependency to enable libvirt's Xen features.
  * don't include precompiled examples in the doc package (Closes: #456825)
  * remove RHism from manpage (Closes: #455859)
  * bump standards version
  * make libs match overrides
  * move to team maintenance
  * suggest dnsmasq and bridge-utils for qemu networking
  * remove stale PID files
