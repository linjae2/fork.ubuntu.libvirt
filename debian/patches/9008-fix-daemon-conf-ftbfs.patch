Description: don't FTBFS on Ubuntu's buildd
 Disable running libvirtd with a valid config file, which has multiple
 problems on the Ubuntu buildd. Also, don't fail on waiting for the pid, but
 instead warn that it failed and show the log. In 0.7.2 this was all that was
 needed but with 0.7.5 need to disable starting libvirtd entirely.
 .
 The problem is sometimes the path to the unix socket is too long and
 libvirtd fails to start. Upstream was alerted to this and a fix will hopefully
 appear soon.
 .
 Another problem exists because the dbus message bus is not available in the
 Ubuntu buildd. This causes the following errors:
 19:04:36.834: error : halDeviceMonitorStartup:722 : dbus_bus_get failed
 19:04:36.834: error : halDeviceMonitorStartup:780 : org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.FileNotFound: Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory
 19:04:36.856: error : main:3089 : Driver state initialization failed
 .
 This portion of the test needs to stay disabled until these issues are fully
 resolved.
