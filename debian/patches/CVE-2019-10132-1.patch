Subject: [PATCH] admin: reject clients unless their UID matches the current UID
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The admin protocol RPC messages are only intended for use by the user
running the daemon. As such they should not be allowed for any client
UID that does not match the server UID.

Fixes CVE-2019-10132
