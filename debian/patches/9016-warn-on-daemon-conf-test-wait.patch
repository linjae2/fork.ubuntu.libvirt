Description: don't FTBFS on Ubuntu's buildd
 Don't fail on waiting for the pid, but instead warn that it failed and show
 the log.
 .
 The problem is sometimes the path to the unix socket is too long and
 libvirtd fails to start. Upstream was alerted to this and a fix will hopefully
 appear soon.
 .
 Another problem exists because the dbus message bus is not available in the
 Ubuntu buildd. This causes the following errors:
 19:04:36.834: error : halDeviceMonitorStartup:722 : dbus_bus_get failed
 19:04:36.834: error : halDeviceMonitorStartup:780 : org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.FileNotFound: Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory
 19:04:36.856: error : main:3089 : Driver state initialization failed
 .
 This portion of the test needs to stay disabled until these issues are fully
 resolved.
