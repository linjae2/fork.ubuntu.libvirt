Description: Wait for qemu-kvm to have the module initialized
 It was reported that in rare occasions libvirt might start up while
 the kvm module is (re)loading. That can cause the capability probing
 qemu processes to abort and let libvirtd hang on initialization.
 Waiting on qemu-kvm is rather safe and reasonable, but is an ubuntu-only
 service and therefore not generally applicable.
 If qemu-kvm isn't installed or not enabled this is a no-op as it is only
 an "After" rule for ordering.
