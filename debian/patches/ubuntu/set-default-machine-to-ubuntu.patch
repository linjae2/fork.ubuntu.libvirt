Description: set default machine type to ubuntu
 Upstream qemu is about to change the default machine type to q35.
 But libvirt has sort of an API-contract that guarantees to have the
 default be at a "pc" type.
 Note: it can not be overemphasized that users/tools should choose a type
 themselves in any cases possible
 .
 Due to those changes in qemu libvirt now ignores the qemu default type.
 But we want the latest distro machine type the default.
 Qemu only provides max one alias per type, so we can not set "ubuntu"
 which is the default we provided for users asking for the latest type
 matching the current series AND at the same time an alias to "pc" which
 is what libvirt now explicitly selects.
 .
 The lowest amount of confusion is to let libvirt select "ubuntu" instead of
 "pc" as the default. That matches all former Ubuntu releases where "ubuntu"
 was the default qemu provided and libvirt picked up and at the same time it
 stays a pc-based type as required by libvirt.
 .
 Distro-only: as the machine types only are that way to maintain
 differences between pure upstream and derived qemu implementation.
