Subject: cpu: define the 'virt-ssbd' CPUID feature bit (CVE-2018-3639)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

Some AMD processors only support a non-architectural means of
enabling Speculative Store Bypass Disable. To allow simplified
handling in virtual environments, hypervisors will expose an
architectural definition through CPUID bit 0x80000008_EBX[25].
This needs to be exposed to guest OS running on AMD x86 hosts to
allow them to protect against CVE-2018-3639.

Note that since this CPUID bit won't be present in the host CPUID
results on physical hosts, it will not be enabled automatically
in guests configured with "host-model" CPU unless using QEMU
version >= 2.9.0. Thus for older versions of QEMU, this feature
must be manually enabled using policy=force. Guests using the
"host-passthrough" CPU mode do not need special handling.
