Subject: [PATCH 33/33] UBUNTU-only: apparmor: for kvm.powerpc (LP: #1680384)

The (so far) Ubuntu only kvm wrappers call a lot more on ppc.
Since this is already considered as the qemu binary it must be opened up
in apparmor to work.
So allow these extra tools executed by kvm.powerpc

Forwarded: no (part of continuous upstreaming effort)
