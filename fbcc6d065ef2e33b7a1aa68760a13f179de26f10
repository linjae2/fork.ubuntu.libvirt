  * debian/patches/9091-apparmor.patch: sync with upstream for maintenance,
    licensing compliance with upstream and bug fixes:
    - handle files with spaces in the name (LP: #432810)
    - add serial, console, kernel and initrd support (LP: #432581)
    - allow read only access to /boot, /vmlinuz and /initrd.img
    - allow access to character devices (eg USB devices)
    - have virt-aa-helper accept XML on stdin, which allows for adding
      other devices in the future and helps ensure we always have the most
      up to date definition
    - update profile on attach and detach of devices (LP: #435527)
    - add --dryrun option to virt-aa-helper, and greatly improve the
      virt-aa-helper-test script
  * revert workaround for LP: #431090 now that kernel, initrd, et al is
    properly supported
  * debian/apparmor/usr.sbin.libvirtd: add various capabilities
    recommended by upstream to prevent potential regressions
