  * Merge from debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - debian/control:
      + DebianMaintainerField
      + Don't build-depend on QEmu.
      + Add "XS-Original-" prefix to Debian's Vcs headers.
      + Bump bridge-utils, dnsmasq-base, netcat-openbsd, and iptables to Depends
        of libvirt-bin.
      + s/interract/interact/g
    - Add libvirt0-dbg package
    - debian/libvirt-bin.default
      + Make libvirtd start by default
    - Add /var/lib/libvirt to libvirt-bin package. (dnsmasq needs it to store
      its state info.
    - Create /var/run/libvirt in libvirt-bin's init script.
    - Install PolicyKit and sasl stuff in libvirt-bin.
    - Rename libvirt group to libvirtd.
    - Build iscsi and disk storage support.
    - delayed_iff_up_bridge.patch: Don't try to bring up the bridge before at
      least one interface has been added to it.
    - dont_clobber_existing_bridges.patch: Assign the name of the virtual
      bridge dynamically to avoid interfering with existing bridges.
    - nic-model.patch: Add support for <model type='foo'/> NIC configuration.
    - disk-bus.patch:  Add support for bus='foo' attributes for disk targets.
    - better_default_uri_virsh.patch: Default to qemu:///system if the user
      has write access to the libvirt socket, otherwise qemu:///session.
    - ancient_parted.patch: Fix builds against libparted1.7
  * no need to depend on python-all-dev we only build an extension for
    the current python version
  * only build-dep on qemu on architectures that have it  
    (Closes: #476290)
  * the packages containing the daemon should suggest polkit
  * drop the {build-,}dependency on open-iscsi too 
  * suggest policykit
  * disable the iscsi storage backend until #423368 is fixed in unstable
  * disable polkit authentication by default so the libvirt stays accessible
    for members of the libvirt group
  * drop no-mac.diff - applied upstream
  * no need to explicitly link against libpthread
  * always enable debugging
  * add Homepage URL
  * add Vcs-{Git,Browser} fields
  * symlink devhelp docs
  * enable policy kit
  * new upstream version
       * Xen 3.2 fixes
       * storage pool support
  * partition based storage pools are disabled, since this needs parted 1.8
    which is only in experimental
  * update patches for new upstream release
       * boot-dev-error.diff - applied upstream
       * qemu-parse-error.diff - applied upstream
       * qemu-path.diff - adjust to new hypervisor detection code
       * rediff the rest
  * new patches:
       * no-mac.diff: don't set mac address on tun device since it breaks kvm
  * bump shlibs version 
  * depend on libxen-dev (Closes:#467598)
  * allow members of the libvirt group to manage virtual machines
  * thanks to the xen maintainers Debian now has a working libxen-dev, so
    enable xen support in the default build (Closes: #453826)
  * recommend netcat-openbsd for unix domain socket support (Closes: #453627)
  * README.Debian: document necessary xend options
  * fix spelling of Python 
  * don't segfault on broken boot device configuration (Closes: #463686)
  * don't segfault due to missing errorhandling in the XML parsing code
  * add and remove the libvirt group for the socket
  * be a bit more verbose on libvirtd reload
  * depend on adduser since we add the libvirt user
  * don't restart libvirtd on upgrades since it kills running qemus
  * enable debugging via DEB_BUILD_OPTS
